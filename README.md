****Project Vision****

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are facing an increase in targeted cyberattacks but often lack the techncal expertise or financial resources to manage incidents effectively. While there are many open-source and commercial tools to detect attacks, the real issue for SMEs comes with understanding and responding to those alerts. 

This project aims to build an affordable, locally hosted, LLM-powered incident response assistant for SMEs that interprets and communicates cybersecurity events clearly and effectively. By integrating existing open-source detection tools with a lightweight local Large Language Model (LLM), the system translates technical alerts into simple, summarised descriptions with risk scores and recommended mitigation steps. 

The goal is to provide SMEs with a low-cost incident management dashboard that helps them understand what has happened, how serious it is, and what steps to take to mitigate the threat - without requring deep technical knowledge.
